# Photo-Gallery
## Sprint One: (Completed January 27, 2020)
1. allows user to take photos and stores these on a file system folder,
2. automatically tags each captured photo with the current timestamp,
3. allows user to add and/or edit a caption to the photo, and supports time as well as caption based search of the photos and ability to view these photos.

4. automated UI Tests for the add/edit caption as well as time/location based search functionality of the app should be developed using Espresso (preferrably before the development of these features starts as per BDD) 

## Sprint Two:
1. photo location tagging,

2. location based search, 

3. uploading of photos to social media sites,

4. unit tests using JUnit,

5. automation of location based search
